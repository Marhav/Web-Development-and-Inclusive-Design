            <h1>Problem</h1>
            <p>The single biggest problem mankind faces today
                 is the enviromental crisis. High emission-rates and waste of resources
                 are just some of the many causes for it, that we as a society are behind.</p>

            <h1>Solution</h1>
            <p>Although we cannot fix the entire enviromental crisis with one app, small
                steps in the right direction can make a big difference. We want to make it easier
                for people to make conscious choices in their everyday life, together with their friends.
                Little by little, we'll make those steps towards a better world a little shorter.
