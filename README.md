# Web Development and Inclusive Design
DAFE1200 - Final Project

### Assignment
---
In this assignment we were tasked with creating a website for an imaginary mobile application that we came up with. 

### Demands
---
The assigment was highly focused around accessability and we followed the guidelines given in WCAG to the best of our ability. 
The page has high contrast and is structured in a way that is arranged for screenreaders, so that visually impaired users may access the pages content.

### Restrictions
---
The assignment restricts us to using only HTML and CSS, since not appearantly not all browsers support JS. This has created some interesting challenges like on the page about the app which is purely HTML and CSS.
