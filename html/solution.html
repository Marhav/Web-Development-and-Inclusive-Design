                    <h2>Our Solution</h2>

                    <p>
                        We recognize that it is not possible to solve the climate problem on our own.  We hope that we can overcome this grand challenge if we cooperate. We must expand the awareness, such that everyone can contribute,
                        instead of a few doing a lot. In our solution we want to bring awareness through challenges and competitions between
                        friends through official events and individual performances. In addition, we seek to give people an incentive to be a part of the solution
                        through internal challenges and meaningful awards that can be spent on benefits from our sponsors. All of
                        this will be accomplished through our wonderful app, Climate+. Let us explain how we have realized this!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="text" tabindex=0>
                
                    <div id="header2"></div>

                    <h2>Earning Points</h2>

                    <p>
                        There are multiple ways to earn points. The method that accumulate the most points are the officially
                        hosted events. These events can be anything imaginable as long as it contributes to a better environment e.g. planting trees or cleaning a riverside full of plastic to meeting up at protests.
                        The amount of points each event rewards are decided by the time commitment and difficulty of the tasks set by the host. However,
                        there are also other ways to obtain points individually. Will require you to connect Climate+ to
                        various environmental friendly apps and reap additional points when using their services e.g. commuting by train instead of flight, in addition to scanning the
                        receipt from recycling bottles.</p>

                <div class="text" tabindex=0>
                
                <div id="header3"></div>

                    <h2>Leaderboard</h2>

                    <p>
                        Now to the fun part; the competition between you and your friends. Once you receive points, they will
                        count towards your ladder ranking. There will be official national and global ladders, but we highly
                        recommend that you also create your own ladder with a group of friends. This way you can keep track of your friends' current rating and try to stay ahead. While there are no rewards for winning a private ladder, we
                        imagine competetive people that wants some extra excitement could implement their own rewards privately.<br>
                        Ladders are divided into seasons to provide people who falls behind a new chance to get to the top. After a new season has
                        begun everybody start from scratch, with a rating of zero. However, your accumulated points so far will not be reset. You rating is purely based on how much
                        points you have been able to acquire during the specific season.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Benefits</h2>

                    <p>
                        Finally, the points you have acquired will decide your rank in the ladder, points can also
                        be spent on all kind of rewards that are provided by our sponsors in the app's benefit page. Moreover, you do not lose your rating
                        when you spend points. As mentioned, you will keep your points after a season ends, however they will not count towards your rating in the upcoming seasons.
