                    <h2>Our Solution</h2>

                    <p>
                        We understand that we cannot solve a problem of such enormous scale, as the climate problem, on our
                        own. In fact, no one can solve such a problem alone. We can only hope that we are able overcome this
                        grand challenge if we work together. We must expand the awareness, so that everyone can do something,
                        instead of a few doing a lot. In our solution we want to bring awareness through challenges between '
                        friendship and official events. Then we want to give people an incentive to go out and do something
                        by them getting into these internal challenges or awarding them with meaningful benefits. All of
                        this will be accomplished through our wonderful app, Climate+. Let me explain you how!
                    </p>

                <div class="text" tabindex=0>
                
                    <div id="header2"></div>

                    <h2>Earning Points</h2>

                    <p>There are several ways to earn points. The action which rewards the most points is the officially
                        hosted events. These events can be anything you can imagine that contribute to a better environment.
                        Everything from planting threes or cleaning a riverside full of plastic to meeting up at protests.
                        How much points each event rewards are decided by the time commitment and difficulty of the tasks. But
                        there are other more passive ways to obtain points. One way of doing this would be to connect
                        different environmentally friendly apps and reap additional benefits when using their services. For
                        example, if you choose to travel with by train instead of flight. Another way is scanning your
                        receipt from returnable bottles.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="text" tabindex=0>
                
                <div id="header3"></div>

                    <h2>Leaderboard</h2>

                    <p>Now to the fun part, the competition between you and your friends. Once you receive points, they will
                        count towards your ladder rating. There are some official national or global ladders, but we highly
                        recommend you create your own ladder with just your friends. This way you can keep a close eye on your
                        friendâ€™s actions and try to stay ahead. While there are no rewards for winning a private ladder, we
                        imagine people who want some extra excitement could make their own bets between one another.<br>
                        Ladders have seasons to give people who fall behind a new chance later on. After a new season has
                        begun everybody start from scratch, with a rating of zero. You rating is purely based on how much
                        points you have been able to acquire during the specific season.
                    </p>

                <div class="text" tabindex=0>
                
                <div id="header4"></div>

                    <h2>Benefits</h2>

                    <p>Finally, the exciting rewards. In addition to be a tool to rate you in the ladders, points can also
                        be spent on all kinds of rewards in the apps benefit page. Not to worry, you do not lose your rating
                        when you spend points. Also, you will keep your points after a season ends, but they will now give
                        any rating in the new season. Rewards are come from sponsor partners who want to support the
                        environment. </p>
